# sidebar
In this project, our goal is to create a sidebar menu in this project. At the top right of the website, you can find a hamburger icon. 
Upon clicking on it, the menu appears smoothly, featuring multiple options with a beautiful hovering effect.
We'll also create a logo as an SVG image and obtain a cross icon from Font Awesome. Clicking the cross icon will close the menu.
